# Introduction
Long story short, I had a discussion with an old friend who is finishing his PhD in mathematical topology. He mentioned one of his projects on optimizing autoencoders to preserve topological features in the latent space—something highly relevant to his research. That conversation made me realize that I had never actually done a full autoencoder project myself, so I decided to give it a try.

This project explores an autoencoder trained on multiparameter weather data from Berlin, focusing on reconstruction and monitoring reconstruction error as a simple form of anomaly detection, such as identifying faulty or unusual sensor readings. It was a fun and practical way to dive into autoencoder applications while connecting to real-world data.
